         <h1>Data Dunkers Foundations</h1>
    <p>This introductory format focuses on engaging students with the core concepts of data science through the lens of basketball. Utilizing both their own data and data from the NBA/WNBA, participants will learn to make performance improvement recommendations for basketball jump shots.</p>
    <h2>Key Components</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Basic data analysis and storytelling</li>
        <li>Learn to use Jupyter Notebook for data input processing and visualization</li>
        <li>Develop and pitch recommendations based on data analysis</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Driving Question for Data Dunkers Fundamentals</h2>
    <p>"What can the data from professional basketball players' performance, like Pascal Siakam's jump shots, tell us about the principles of good shooting and how can we apply these insights to improve our own game?"</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Learning Modules</h2>
    <p>These modules represent the core of the Data Dunkers program. Using data collected by the students they learn about the basic process that data scientists go through. They then apply these skills to the larger data set of the NBA or WNBA to identify a trend or specific question. They will develop a recommendation for their personal or class performance based on this larger trend and present that in a pitch.</p>

        <p><b>Purpose</b>: This module is designed to enhance students' ability to communicate data analysis findings by teaching them how to select and create effective visualizations. Utilizing pandas and Plotly within Jupyter Notebooks, students will learn to craft compelling stories with their data through the use of various plot types such as bar graphs, scatter plots, pie charts, and histograms. The focus is on developing a nuanced understanding of how visual representations can alter perceptions of data and underscore certain narratives or findings.</p>

        <h3>Learning Focus</h3>
        <p><b>Concept: Data Visualization Techniques</b></p>
        <ul>
    <li><p>Outcome: "I can select the appropriate type of data visualization such as bar graphs, scatter plots, pie charts, or histograms using pandas and Plotly in Jupyter Notebooks and customize these visualizations to effectively communicate my data analysis findings."</p></li>
    <li>        <p>ISTE Student Standards: Knowledge Constructor (3c) - "I can critically curate a variety of resources using digital tools to construct knowledge, produce creative artifacts, and make meaningful learning experiences for myself and others." Creative Communicator (6a) - "I can communicate clearly and express myself creatively for a variety of purposes using the platforms, tools, styles, formats, and digital media appropriate to my goals."</p></li>
</ul> 
        <h3>Launch</h3>
        <p>Begin the module by displaying a dataset to the students and engage them with the question "What story does this data tell us?" Proceed by showing a graph or visualization derived from the same dataset, prompting further discussion with "How does this visualization change our understanding or highlight certain aspects of the data?" Finish by asking "What decisions did I need to make to produce the visualization?" and explain that as data scientists, the creation of visualizations is a methodical process aimed at telling the story hidden within the data, showcasing discoveries and insights.</p>

        <h3>Activities</h3>
        <p>Conduct a hands-on session where the teacher demonstrates the step-by-step process of creating a bar graph using Plotly with the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1peJis68KbNsD1jKwW32g3VOGCqMmdfjwGdGcpeukli8/edit?resourcekey#gid=1955284808">students’ own data set (plus historical</a>) in the Notebook. Students will walk through the same process in their <a href="https://github.com/PS43Foundation/data-dunkers/blob/main/notebooks/live-stats-collection.ipynb">Notebook</a>. The process will include selecting appropriate data, deciding on the type of graph that best represents the data, and any customization of the visualization to make it more informative. Students will be provided with time to create their own visualization. They will then explain what they wanted their visual to 'say' and how they designed their graph to say it. Possible questions they could ask of the data to visualize include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Accuracy vs. Distance Exploration: "How does our shooting get better or worse as we move farther from or closer to the net, and is there a sweet spot where we're hitting the most shots?"</li>
            <li>Pattern in Shot Sequence: "Do we tend to make more shots at the beginning, middle, or end of our shooting practice, and what does that say about how tired we get or how we warm up?"</li>
            <li>Improvement Over Time: "Looking at how we did over several sessions of shots, are we getting better? Can we spot any trends or unexpected changes in how many shots we're making?"</li>
        </ul>
