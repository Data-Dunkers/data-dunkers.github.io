    <!-- LESSON OVERVIEW -->
    <section id="overview" class="card">
      <h2>🎯 Lesson Overview</h2>
      <p><strong>Focus:</strong> Redesign a familiar object or everyday process for inclusivity, accessibility, or sustainability — using AI both as a coach (evaluator/critic) and as an envisioner of how AI could be embedded to transform its use.</p>
      <p><strong>Estimated Duration:</strong> 2 hours (can be split across 2–3 shorter sessions or run as a studio block)</p>
      <p><strong>Stage of the Studio Process:</strong> Problem Scoping</p>

      <h3>ISTE Standards Alignment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1.4 Innovative Designer –</strong> Students apply a design process  to create two versions of a solution: a feasible “now” redesign and a future “AI-embedded” redesign, iterating based on feedback and constraints.</li>
        <li><strong>1.6 Creative Communicator –</strong> Students communicate their problem, rationale, and design choices through sketches, storyboards, and short pitches; they compare “now” vs. “AI-embedded” versions and explain how AI changes the experience.</li>
        <li><strong>1.1 Empowered Learner –</strong> Students use AI purposefully (as coach/evaluator and role-player), make informed decisions about when to accept or reject AI outputs, and reflect on AI’s limits, ethics, and their own responsibility as designers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Learning Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Analyze where everyday designs succeed or fail for different users.</li>
        <li>Use AI as a coach to critique designs and as a role-player to surface diverse perspectives.</li>
        <li>Write a clear problem statement grounded in personas, lived experiences, and AI feedback.</li>
        <li>Prototype two versions of a redesign: what we could do now and what we could do with AI embedded.</li>
        <li>Explain how AI changes user experience, benefits, risks, and ethical considerations.</li>
        <li>Reflect on where human judgment mattered most in my design process.</li>
      </ul>

        <div class="small">
          <h3>Big Goal of the Lesson</h3>
          <p>This lesson grounds students in human-centered design while modeling sophisticated AI use. Students practice empathy and critical evaluation of AI, then produce two connected prototypes: a practical “now” redesign and a visionary “AI-embedded” redesign that shows how intelligence could transform usability, access, and sustainability.</p>
          <h3>How the Lesson Flows</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Spark:</strong> Notice “everyday design fails” and identify opportunities.</li>
            <li><strong>Explore:</strong> Use AI , build personas, and talk with real people; write a concise problem statement.</li>
            <li><strong>Experiment:</strong> Generate and critique redesign ideas, including at least one with AI embedded.</li>
            <li><strong>Create:</strong> Build two prototypes — feasible now and AI-embedded next — annotating how each improves experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Share:</strong> Present both versions; gather targeted peer feedback.</li>
            <li><strong>Reflect:</strong> Evaluate AI’s role , ethics, and where human judgment was essential.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Facilitation Moves</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Keep empathy central; consistently ask “Who benefits? Who’s left out?”</li>
            <li>Require students to annotate AI outputs as useful, impractical, or biased before building.</li>
            <li>Encourage low-tech prototyping first; advanced tools like Autodesk, Tinkercad, SketchUp, or 3D printers are optional extensions.</li>
            <li>Incorporate lived voices (students, staff, family) alongside personas.</li>
            <li>If a real, solvable school problem emerges, guide students in preparing a short pitch to administration or facilities.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Challenge Question</h3>
          <p><em>How might we redesign an everyday object or process so that it works better for more people today — and how could embedding AI meaningfully change that experience tomorrow?</em></p>
          <h3>By the end of the lesson, each team will have:</h3>
          <ul class="checklist">
            <li>A clear, empathy-based problem statement</li>
            <li>A set of annotated redesign ideas (including at least one AI-embedded concept)</li>
            <li>Two connected prototypes: a feasible “Now” redesign and an “AI-Embedded” redesign</li>
            <li>A short presentation and a personal reflection on AI’s value, risks, and limits</li>
          </ul>

      <!-- Spark -->
      <div class="phase" id="spark">
        <h3>🔥 Spark</h3>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Help students see that everyday designs often fail and can exclude users.</p>
        <p><strong>Intended Outcome:</strong> Students identify examples of poor design and begin noticing opportunities for redesign.</p>
        <h4>Mini-Challenge</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Look at 2–3 examples of poor design (images or videos provided).</li>
          <li>Discuss in pairs: What makes each a “fail”? Who might be left out or struggle to use it?</li>
          <li>Brainstorm 2–3 everyday objects or processes from your own life that could be redesigned.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Artifact:</strong> Class list of “design fails” with possible targets for redesign.</p>
        <h4>Facilitator Moves</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Choose examples that are funny, surprising, or relatable to grab attention.</li>
          <li>Probe with: “Who is excluded here?” not just “Why is this annoying?”</li>
          <li>Record brainstorms visibly for all to see. You may want to restrict this to being something at school or in the community to focus on a group issue.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>References</h4>
        <p>Images/videos of poor design.</p>
        <p><strong>Checkpoint:</strong> Students each have at least one object/process they’re interested in redesigning.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Explore -->
      <div class="phase" id="explore">
        <h3>🔎 Explore</h3>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Gather insights through multiple perspectives to ground the design challenge in empathy.</p>
        <p><strong>Intended Outcome:</strong> Students develop a problem statement supported by AI, personas, and lived experiences.</p>
        <h4>Mini-Challenge</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Select one object or process from your Spark brainstorm.</li>
          <li>Use AI to review it:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Option A:</strong> Upload a photo.</li>
              <li><strong>Option B:</strong> Describe it in detail. Record the AI’s feedback on accessibility, usability, or sustainability.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Create 3–4 personas representing diverse users (e.g., elderly adult, multilingual student, someone with mobility challenges, eco-minded user).</li>
          <li>Interview 1–2 real people (classmates, family, staff) and ask: “What is your experience with this object? What works well? What doesn’t?”</li>
          <li>Compare AI insights, persona perspectives, and real experiences.</li>
          <li>Write a short problem statement: “The problem with [object] is… This affects [users] because…”</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Artifact:</strong>  Problem statement capturing AI feedback, persona insights, and lived experiences.</p>
        <h4>Facilitator Moves</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Remind students that personas are imaginative, but lived experience brings authenticity.</li>
          <li>Remind students that personas are individual insights, not representative of an entire group of people.</li>
          <li>Model a short, focused problem statement.</li>
          <li>Encourage identifying contradictions between AI and humans.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>References</h4>
        <p>Access to an LLM/open chatbot for interactions.</p>
        <p><strong>Checkpoint:</strong> Teams can share a clear problem statement that names the object, affected users, and the issue.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Experiment -->
      <div class="phase" id="experiment">
        <h3>🧪 Experiment</h3>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Stretch creativity and test redesign options with AI as a thought partner.</p>
        <p><strong>Intended Outcome:</strong> Students generate multiple annotated redesign ideas, including one with AI embedded.</p>
        <h4>Mini-Challenge</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Ask AI: “How could this object be redesigned to be more inclusive or sustainable?”</li>
          <li>Ask AI: “How could AI be embedded in this object/process to change how it is used?”</li>
          <li>Record at least 3 ideas from AI.</li>
          <li>Annotate each idea: ✔ useful, ✖ impractical, ⚠ biased/problematic.</li>
          <li>Optional: Share the critique of AI’s responses with AI and ask it to improve.</li>
          <li>Add at least one original idea of your own.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Artifact:</strong> Annotated set of redesign options with quick sketches or notes.</p>
        <h4>Facilitator Moves</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Emphasize critique — don’t just accept AI’s outputs.</li>
          <li>Support sketching for visual thinkers (even stick figures are enough).</li>
          <li>Push for both short-term practical and long-term imaginative redesigns.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>References</h4>
        <p>LLM or open chatbot for text responses</p>
        <p><strong>Checkpoint:</strong> Students have 3+ redesign ideas annotated with critiques, including at least one AI-embedded idea.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Create -->
      <div class="phase" id="create">
        <h3>🛠️ Create</h3>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Students move from ideas to action by developing prototypes that demonstrate how human-centered design and AI-enhanced possibilities can coexist. This is where thinking becomes tangible.</p>
        <p><strong>Intended Outcome:</strong> Students produce two related prototypes: one feasible today and one that envisions a future version with AI embedded. Both demonstrate empathy, inclusivity, and sustainability.</p>
        <h4>Challenge Activity: “Build It Better—Now and Next.”</h4>
        <h5>Step 1 – Define the Prototype Goal</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Review your problem statement from Explore.</li>
          <li>Circle or highlight the biggest user challenge you’re addressing.</li>
          <li>Decide whether your prototype will:
            <ul>
              <li>Fix an existing barrier, or</li>
              <li>Reimagine an entirely new experience.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Step 2 – Map Your Two Paths</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>On one sheet (or slide), draw two columns titled:
            <ul>
              <li><em>What We Could Do Now</em></li>
              <li><em>What We Could Do With AI Embedded</em></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Jot  ideas for each: materials, look/feel, interactions, and who benefits.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Step 3 – Create the ‘Now’ Prototype</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Use low-tech materials first: paper, cardboard, modeling clay, slides, or  diagrams.</li>
          <li>Keep it simple—focus on usability and empathy.</li>
          <li>Label parts that address accessibility or sustainability (e.g., recycled materials, clearer signage, easier grip).</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Step 4 – Create the ‘AI-Embedded’ Prototype</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Ask AI tools for help without letting them take over. Example prompts:
            <ul>
              <li>“Describe how AI could make this object adaptive to users’ needs.”</li>
              <li>“Generate a visual of this design functioning in real time.”</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Incorporate the best ideas into your prototype:
            <ul>
              <li>Storyboard how the AI feature works (sensors, data, voice, automation).</li>
              <li>Ora digital mockup showing the AI interaction.</li>
              <li>Add call-outs: What would the AI actually do? What data would it need?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Step 5 – Iterate and Combine</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Compare both versions side by side.</li>
          <li>Ask peers: Which design better meets the user's needs? What ethical or privacy issues appear when AI is added?</li>
          <li>Revise accordingly.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Step 6 – Optional Extensions</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>3D Modeling:</strong> Recreate either prototype digitally using Autodesk, Tinkercad, or SketchUp.</li>
          <li><strong>3D Printing:</strong> Print a scaled model and test physical usability.</li>
          <li><strong>AR/VR Visualization:</strong> Import into a simple AR viewer to see how it fits in real space.</li>
          <li><strong>Community Pitch:</strong> If your redesign solves a genuine school problem, prepare to present it to an administrator or facilities manager for feedback.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Artifact</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Two clear prototypes (feasible Now + AI-Embedded Future).</li>
          <li>Annotated explanation of design choices, materials, and AI functions.</li>
          <li>Optional digital or physical 3D representation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Facilitator Moves</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Model dual-level thinking: show a quick example of “today” vs. “AI-augmented” redesign (e.g., standard classroom light switch to motion-sensing adaptive lighting).</li>
          <li>Circulate early to check that students keep empathy at the core; remind them who they are designing for.</li>
          <li>Prompt reflection mid-build:
            <ul>
              <li>“What evidence tells you this solves the problem?”</li>
              <li>“How will the AI know what to do?”</li>
              <li>“Could the AI ever make a harmful or biased choice?”</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Encourage sketch-and-label over perfection—visual communication matters more than precision modeling.</li>
          <li>Provide tech-tiered support: paper first, digital second, advanced tools optional.</li>
          <li>Celebrate iteration—have students photograph stages to show growth.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Checkpoint</h4>
        <p>Before moving to Share, ensure each team can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Display both prototypes side by side.</li>
          <li>Clearly explain the design improvements in the “Now” version.</li>
          <li>Describe specifically how AI operates in the “Future” version and why it adds value.</li>
          <li>Identify at least one ethical or practical consideration introduced by the AI feature.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

          <li>Answer:
            <ul>
              <li>How did AI act as a coach or evaluator in your process?</li>
              <li>How might embedding AI in your redesign change people’s experiences (positive and negative)?</li>
              <li>Where was human judgment most important?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Artifact:</strong> Reflection log (written or video).</p>
        <h4>Facilitator Moves</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Normalize naming AI’s flaws as well as its helpfulness.</li>
          <li>Encourage connecting reflections back to inclusivity and sustainability.</li>
          <li>Push for specific examples, not general statements.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>References</h4>
        <p>Sustainable Fashion pack: “ego vs. eco” fashion choice and an analogy for AI’s double-edged potential.</p>
        <p><strong>Checkpoint:</strong> Each student identifies at least one way AI helped, one limitation, and one area where human judgment was critical.</p>

      <h3>Extension</h3>
      <h4>Technological Extensions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>3D Design Tools – Move prototypes from sketches to digital design using tools such as Autodesk, SketchUp, or Tinkercad.</li>
        <li>3D Printing – Print the redesigned object as a physical prototype; compare functionality and usability across iterations.</li>
        <li>AR/VR Visualization – Import designs into AR/VR platforms to simulate scale, environment, or user interactions.</li>
        <li>AI Simulation – Use AI modeling tools to simulate sustainability impacts (e.g., energy use, materials lifecycle) or accessibility (e.g., text-to-speech, color contrast evaluators).</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Applied Extensions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Pitch to School Administration – Students formally present their redesigned object/process to school leadership if it addresses a real challenge (e.g., accessibility of water fountains, recycling bins, cafeteria flow).</li>
        <li>Community Consultation – Share prototypes with stakeholders who might use the redesign (custodial staff, younger students, families) and gather authentic feedback.</li>
        <li>Field Testing – If feasible, test small-scale versions of the redesign in the school or community setting and collect user feedback.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Academic Extensions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Research Connection – Link the object to global examples of inclusive/sustainable design (e.g., universal design in architecture, sustainable product case studies).</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration –</strong> Partner with other subject areas:
          <ul>
            <li><em>Science</em> — sustainability metrics, material analysis.</li>
            <li><em>Social Studies</em> — equity and access across cultures.</li>
            <li><em>Language Arts</em> — persuasive writing for proposals.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Policy Exploration – Students investigate what rules, policies, or guidelines would support or hinder the adoption of their redesign.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Creative Extensions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Marketing Campaign – Design posters, videos, or social media content to advocate for the redesigned object.</li>
        <li>Storytelling Prototype – Create a comic, storyboard, or video that shows a “day in the life” of someone using the redesigned object.</li>
        <li>Futurecasting – Write or illustrate a vision of how their AI-embedded redesign might evolve 10–20 years from now.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Reflection Extensions</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Ethics Roundtable – Students debate: If AI is embedded in everyday objects, what risks or responsibilities come with it?</li>
        <li>User Advisory Board Simulation – Students role-play as different user groups (e.g., admin, parents, accessibility advocates) and critique designs.</li>
        <li>Personal Action Plan – Students identify one everyday item they can change in their own lives (clothing choice, study setup, digital tool use) using lessons learned.</li>
      </ul>
