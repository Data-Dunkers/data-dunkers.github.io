## How to play Bump (Knock-Out)

* Form a single line at the free-throw line.
* The first two players get a basketball.
* The first player shoots. If they miss, they quickly grab the ball and shoot again.
* You can start shooting as soon as the player in front takes their first shot.
* If you make a basket, pass the ball to the next player and go to the back of the line.
* If you score before the player in front of you, they are out.
* Keep playing until only one player remains.

### Post-Game Analysis Questions

* How accurate were the predictions?
* Which factors (from our data set) were most related?
* Are there other factors we should have measured?
* How could we get the AI to create fair (even) teams for a game?
