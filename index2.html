        <h2><font color="#1f75ff">Welcome to Data Dunkers!</font></h2> 
        <p>Data Dunkers is an innovative basketball and data science learning experience for students in grades 5-12. Students learn foundational data science skills through basketball statistics in a fun and inclusive environment.
The program consists of learning activities designed to explore how to find meaning in data, primarily using open data from the NBA and WNBA. Students engage in the data analysis process by identifying a focus question, gathering, cleansing, and examining data, followed by clearly presenting their findings. This process serves as a launchpad for global competencies, such as critical thinking and problem solving, and for discovering career pathways within the realm of data science.</p> 

<p>The program, a partnership between PS43 Foundation and Dell Technologies, and involving collaborations with Callysto and Digital Moments, aims to make Data Science real and meaningful for students.  </p>
<p>The Data Dunkers program is offered in two pathways:   </p>
