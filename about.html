     <p class="paragraph"> <ul>
        <li>The amount of data in our world has exponentially increased over the past two decades, yet the opportunities to learn about data and acquire data-related skills remain few and far between.</li>
        <li>Data Science can help make more informed decisions, answer questions, and discover new directions to look in.</li>
        <li>Data Scientist is considered to be a top in-demand occupation
            <ul>
                <li>Data analysts and scientists, artificial intelligence, and big data professionals ranked as the top 3 jobs demanded globally. (<a href="https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2020.pdf">World Economic Forum, 2020</a>)</li>
                <li>The share of global companies planning to adopt “big data” analytics (90%+), cybersecurity (85%+), and artificial intelligence (80%+) has increased during COVID. (<a href="https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2020.pdf">World Economic Forum, 2020</a>)</li>

     <summary><b><font color="#4710a0">Instructional Approach</font></b> </summary>   
  
  <p>The Data Dunkers program employs a hands-on, project-based learning approach to engage students in data science through the lens of basketball sports analytics. This approach is characterized by several key strategies:
<ul >   
<li>
 <b>Engagement through Physical Activity</b>: To keep students engaged, the program intersperses short lesson segments with basketball games. This strategy not only breaks up the monotony of classroom learning but also helps to reinforce the connection between the physical sport and its analytical aspects.
</li><li>
<b>Project-Based Learning</b>: Students work on individual or small group data science projects, applying what they've learned to real-world basketball data. This allows them to explore their interests, develop critical thinking, and apply problem-solving skills in a practical context.
</li><li>
<b>Focus on Application of Tools and Skills</b>: The curriculum introduces students to Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and libraries like pandas and Plotly, equipping them with modern data science tools and skills. This includes both coding and analytical techniques, as well as the ability to interpret and tell stories with data.
</li><li>
<b>Adaptation to Student Needs</b>: Recognizing varying levels of prior knowledge and interest, the program is designed to be accessible to beginners while still offering depth for more experienced students. This adaptability helps to ensure that all participants can find value and growth in the experience.
</li></ul>

    <summary><b><font color="#4710a0">Learning Activity Components</font></b></summary>
    <p>The learning modules of the Data Dunkers program are structured around a blend of technical instruction, hands-on application, and physical activity. This design aims to not only practice data science skills but also to foster a holistic understanding of how these skills can be applied to real-world scenarios, particularly in the context of sports analytics. The inclusion of physical activity and project-based approaches helps to make the program engaging and relevant to students' interests, potentially inspiring a lifelong interest in both data science and sports.
     </p>
    <p>Key components include:</p>
    <ul >
        <li>
            <b>Foundational Concepts:</b> Introduction to Python programming, focusing on basic syntax and essential libraries for data analysis, such as pandas and Plotly.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Data Analysis Projects:</b> Students undertake projects that involve analyzing open data from the NBA and WNBA, allowing them to apply coding and analytical skills to real datasets.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Integration of Design Thinking:</b> Lessons include elements of design thinking to encourage creativity in how data is presented and stories are told through graphs and analyses.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Physical Activities:</b> Basketball games and exercises are integrated into the curriculum to reinforce the connection between the data analysis work and the physical sport, enhancing engagement and understanding.
