   <h2>Learning Modules</h2> 
   <p>The Data Dunkers program empowers students to craft their unique data narratives, addressing a series of compelling questions. Through this guided journey, participants actively enhance their data science expertise, applying key skills and concepts by immersing themselves in the art and science of data storytelling. 
   It's designed to foster an experiential learning environment where students not only gain conceptual understanding but also apply what they learn in creating meaningful, data-driven presentations. </p>
   <p>  The Learning Modules for the Data Dunkers program have been designed to be flexible to support a variety of program approaches. You can embed them in your school day and cross-connect them with other subject areas, hold a series of after-school sessions, or have a number of 1/2 or full day events around the program.

    <p><h3> Program Structure</h3></p>
    
     <details>
     <summary><b><font color="#4710a0">Instructional Approach</font></b> </summary>
  
  <p>The Data Dunkers program employs a hands-on, project-based learning approach to engage students in data science through the lens of basketball sports analytics. This approach is characterized by several key strategies:
<ul >   
<li>
 <b>Engagement through Physical Activity</b>: To keep students engaged, the program intersperses short lesson segments with basketball games. This strategy not only breaks up the monotony of classroom learning but also helps to reinforce the connection between the physical sport and its analytical aspects.
</li><li>
<b>Project-Based Learning</b>: Students work on individual or small group data science projects, applying what they've learned to real-world basketball data. This allows them to explore their interests, develop critical thinking, and apply problem-solving skills in a practical context.
</li><li>
<b>Focus on Application of Tools and Skills</b>: The curriculum introduces students to Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and libraries like pandas and Plotly, equipping them with modern data science tools and skills. This includes both coding and analytical techniques, as well as the ability to interpret and tell stories with data.
</li><li>
<b>Adaptation to Student Needs</b>: Recognizing varying levels of prior knowledge and interest, the program is designed to be accessible to beginners while still offering depth for more experienced students. This adaptability helps to ensure that all participants can find value and growth in the experience.
